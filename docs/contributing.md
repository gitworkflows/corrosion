First off, thank you for considering contributing to Corrosion! It's people like you that make open-source software such a great community. We welcome any type of contribution, not only code.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by a Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior. (Note: A CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file would be created in a real project).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

-   **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under Issues.
-   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

-   Open a new issue with the title "Feature Request: [Your Feature]".
-   Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature, why it would be useful, and if possible, how it might be implemented.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2.  Set up your local development environment by following the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md).
3.  Make your changes. Please add tests if you're adding new functionality.
4.  Ensure your code lints and passes all CI checks.
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Development Workflow

-   All development happens in feature branches.
-   Pull requests should be small and focused on a single issue or feature.
-   All pull requests must pass the CI checks before they can be merged.

We look forward to your contributions!
