# GitHub Issue Labels

We use GitHub labels to organize and prioritize our work. This guide will help you understand what our labels mean.

## Type Labels

These labels categorize the type of issue.

-   `bug`: Something isn't working as expected.
-   `feature-request`: A new feature or enhancement suggestion.
-   `documentation`: An issue related to improving the documentation.
-   `question`: A question about the project that isn't a bug or feature request.
-   `good-first-issue`: A great issue for new contributors to tackle.

## Status Labels

These labels indicate the current status of an issue or pull request.

-   `needs-triage`: The issue has not yet been reviewed by the core team.
-   `in-progress`: The issue is actively being worked on.
-   `blocked`: Progress is blocked by another issue or external factor.
-   `needs-discussion`: The issue requires more discussion before work can begin.
-   `wontfix`: The core team has decided not to work on this issue.

## Priority Labels

-   `priority-high`: This issue is critical and should be addressed as soon as possible.
-   `priority-medium`: This issue is important but not urgent.
-   `priority-low`: This issue is a nice-to-have but is not a high priority.

By using these labels, we can quickly filter and find issues, making project management more efficient for everyone.
