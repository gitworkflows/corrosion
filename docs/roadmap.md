# Corrosion Project Roadmap

This document outlines the future direction for the Corrosion toolkit. Our goal is to provide a transparent look at our upcoming priorities. This roadmap is a living document and may change based on community feedback and technical discoveries.

## Q3 2024: Stability and Developer Experience

-   [ ] **Official CLI Tool**: A dedicated command-line interface for creating, building, and managing Corrosion projects (`corrosion create`, `corrosion build`).
-   [ ] **Hot Reloading**: Implement hot-reloading for the WebView frontend during development to improve developer velocity.
-   [ ] **Plugin API v1.0**: Stabilize the Rust and JavaScript APIs for plugin development, providing clear documentation and examples.
-   [ ] **Expanded Documentation**: Add tutorials and guides for more advanced topics like custom protocols and deep linking.

## Q4 2024: Expanding the Ecosystem

-   [ ] **Official Plugin Repository**: Launch a website to discover and share community-built plugins.
-   [ ] **Cross-Compilation Support**: Streamline the process for compiling for Windows/macOS from a Linux machine, and vice-versa.
-   [ ] **Mobile Tooling Enhancements**: Improve the integration with Android Studio and Xcode for easier debugging of native plugin code.
-   [ ] **Performance Profiling Tools**: Integrate tools to help developers diagnose performance bottlenecks in both the Rust core and the JS-Rust bridge.

## Future Ideas (Under Consideration)

-   Updater plugin for automatic application updates.
-   Support for alternative frontend frameworks with official templates.
-   Deno compatibility for the frontend API.
